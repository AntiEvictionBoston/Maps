    story: `Based on many stories we’ve heard from the frontlines of evictions and rent-increases in Boston, East Boston is one of the hardest-hit neighborhoods. Large corporate landlords like Hodara Real Estate Group, Newman Properties, RJ Leyden and Aaron Daigneault are buying and redeveloping scores of homes throughout East Boston, raising rents and forcing no-fault evictions in process, while 2016 began with over 10 larger high-end housing developments underway.`

Marta adds, "We're always talking with the people in our community about what's going on in East Boston, that they should push for their rights, that they should know that we have rights too."`,

    Ms. Zhong lives with her husband and two daughters downstairs from Ms. Huang. In 2015, their row-house style building was sold to a new owner for over 1 million dollars. 
    
    The landlord raised Ms. Huang's rent in 2015 by $300 a month, and in 2016 is seeking to raise the rent again by another $250. Ms. Huang asked the landlord to lower the rate of rent increases, because her family is now paying more than 50% of their income in rent.
    
    Ms. Zhong's rent has risen by several hundred dollars to a total of $2600 per month. Because Ms. Zhong's family can't afford $2600 per month, and they're unable to find an affordable alternative in Chinatown, they're likely to be displaced from Chinatown in the spring of 2016."`,

    Three other Chinese families lived in the building. In April of 2015, the building was sold for $2.86 million to Tremont Development LLC 615. The principal agent for the LLC is Sean Kennedy who also owns Kennedy Design and Building LLC, which specializes in converting apartments to luxury condos. 
    
    As soon as 615 Tremont Street LLC bought the building, they started clearing out the building of the former residents. By the end of summer 2015, Ms. Ye and her family were the only ones left in the building because they have no place to move to. They continue to be the only ones left, and it's uncertain where the family will end up.`,
